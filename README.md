# ❔ What can this asset be used for?

Whenever user presses the fire button in a shooter game, a certain reaction from the weapon can be seen on the screen, this is called recoil in video games. Recoil consists of 3 main parts:
- Controller recoil (this makes player's camera go to the skies)
- Camera shake
- Weapon animation

The last part, sometimes referred as visual recoil or recoil animation, fakes the firearms' physics when firing.

With this plugin you can create and modify weapon animations on the fly.
